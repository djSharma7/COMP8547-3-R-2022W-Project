Possible Solutions» Business Meeting Horizon 2020 framework programme Software developed in NMU Partner search forthe implementation of promising projects Increasing of energy efficiency of production equipment operations NMU opportunities in research field NTU "DP", defining its strategy towards innovation activity and improving the technology transfer process, initiated research activities through open platforms: industrial technological and innovation, having placed in the public access the accumulated experience of solving practical problems of various industries and the results of basic researches. We would like to create a platform for communication, combining efforts in research, technology and innovation development, basing on the needs of economy. We are ready to adapt our results on solving specific problems of your enterprises, we are open for research cooperation with other enthusiastic people, because this cooperation leads to growth and progress. In order to integrate into the International Technology Transfer Net the University has started working on forming of technology profiles compatible with European formats, which may reveal the essence of technology so that to show its significance and importance for potential users or investors. The profiles are completed by the project managers in languages: in Ukrainian and English with obligatory indication of key words. The authors of the NTU "DP" offers several projects aimed at improving the energy efficiency of enterprises by reducing energy consumption of production equipment. The developed methods of conduction energy audit will allow to identify the need to use energy-saving technologies. The project details are provided on our innovation platform open for the technical communication and targets solution.
